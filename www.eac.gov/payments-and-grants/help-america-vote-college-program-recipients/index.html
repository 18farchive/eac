Program Name: CCSU Student Poll Worker Program<br>
Funding Level: $32,107.00<br>
Project Description: Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) will work with the Connecticut Association of Town Clerks to recruit 250 college poll workers by building off of the pilot program of 2004 HAVCP grantee, Asnuntuck Community College (ACC).

Students will be required to enroll in a one credit hybrid U.S. Elections and Civic Engagement course that will focus on serving as a poll worker. By combining an academic course with a civic engagement project, CCSU hopes that the program will not only develop a stronger sense of community amongst students and an increased level of knowledge about civil society, but will also produce an increased likelihood of students participating in civic activities in the future. CCSU’s program will go beyond the ACC program by sending out follow-up surveys to measure changes in attitudes towards civic participation among college students participating in the program.<br>

Program Name: Help Coloradans Vote<br>
Funding Level: $74,611<br>
Project Description: Colorado Campus Compact (Regis University is the host partner) and Just Vote Colorado (a program from Colorado Common Cause), will implement a series of strategies designed to engage college students as poll workers and build a long-term commitment to civic engagement. In Year One, efforts will focus on college students in Denver. Leadership will be provided by Colorado Campus Compact’s largest and most diverse inner-city campuses. Year Two will expand to include Northern and Southern Colorado, the Eastern plains and the Western Slope. The community partners will be the Colorado Secretary of State’s office, Denver Elections Division, Larimer County Clerk’s Office, and other county election offices. A Colorado Election Fellows Program will establish 35 Fellowships to be awarded on a competitive basis to students at Metropolitan State College of Denver (Metro), University of Colorado-Denver (UCD), and the University of Denver (DU). Multilingual students and/or students who can readily reach out to people with disabilities will be encouraged to apply through working with student organizations and broad advertising via these institutions’ e-mail and experiential learning and service centers. The goal of the Colorado Elections Fellows program will be to provide students with an incentive to both participate on Election Day as poll workers and to recruit other students. The program has a goal of eight student recruits per fellow for a total of 280 students. A service-learning unit will also be developed that can be implemented in various campus courses as a means to recruit and train poll workers. Masters level students in political science will be engaged in program evaluation.</p>

Program Name: South Carolina Young Voters Initiative<br>
Funding Level: $74,929<br>
Project Description: This program will recruit and train of a new generation of technologically savvy election workers from five historically black colleges and five traditional colleges to sustain South Carolina’s new unified election system, create an ongoing relationship between colleges and their county election boards to insure recruitment of future student workers, and develop a replicable program model for distribution to all 46 county election boards in the state. The pilot project will underwrite training and deployment of 50 student election workers in elections in November 2009, and an additional 250 in the general elections in November 2010. More than one-third of these students will be non-white or from among those who might have been excluded from participation due to physical challenges. The strategy for the pilot project is focused on outreach through innovative media, special high-profile recruitment events, and informational activities. A key final outcome will be a Guide to the Recruitment of Students and Disadvantaged Youth as Election Workers in South Carolina based on data collection, research, and evaluation of student poll workers’ participation in the 2009 and 2010 elections.</p>

EMU's American Democracy Project was awarded a $25,000 grant to recruit students to serve as poll workers in the City of Ypsilanti, MI. In the Fall of 2005 EMU also required students to be poll workers for the city of Detroit, MI. &nbsp;Additional students served in a motivational and logistic support capacity. Students created brochures, facts sheets, and developed a web presence that focused on the election process, voter registration and voter education. Students also attend a workshop that educated them about their rights and responsibilities as U.S. Citizens and increased their understanding and participation in the political process. &nbsp;EMU found that classroom announcements and offering extra credit were the most success requiting tools. Targeting student clubs and organizations was less effective. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
