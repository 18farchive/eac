Using a new visual display and logistics tracking software from Tenex Software Solutions, the Gloucester County Superintendent of Elections scanned more than 2,000 items of election technology during the receiving process on Election Night. After polls close at 8 p.m., the office combined RFID barcode scanning with Tenex's tracking software and visual Ready Board, empowering the elections team to efficiently receive, scan, and secure all voting equipment by 10:30 p.m. This process saved more than two hours during the end-of-night processes. This also gave higher-level administrative staff a quick and easy, color-coded method of identifying where equipment was still outstanding. Gloucester's Ready Board high-level monitoring system is innovative and allows administrators to quickly and accurately review location information and status, streamlining the receiving process and focusing warehouse communications.  &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Improving Accessibility For Voters With Disabilities</h3>

<p><strong>El Paso County Elections Department, Texas - Braille Poll Pad&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Over the past eight years, the El Paso County Elections Department (EPCED) has made improving the voting experience for the disability community a priority. The department covers an ADA section in its poll worker training, but also trains their workers on how to offer the braille poll pad screen for the check-in device, specifically for voters with a visual impairment. In collaboration with El Paso Council of the Blind and a local vendor, the final product was created and implemented in 2016 to serve all early voting and Election Day sites in the county. Since its inception, voters and poll workers have expressed appreciation for the efforts EPCED has made to make polling places and voting machines accessible during each election. Currently, El Paso is the only county in Texas that has created and implemented this “one of a kind” braille screen. The idea to make the check-in process more accessible to visually impaired voters came from the Elections Administrator, Lisa Wise.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Outstanding Innovations in Election Cybersecurity and Technology</h3>

<p><strong>Santa Fe County Clerk's Office, New Mexico - Project Bruno: Tabulator Security Program&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Santa Fe County Clerk's Office has initiated a pilot Tabulator Security Program, demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding our elections against physical theft, unauthorized access, tampering, as well as unforeseen power surges and electrical disruptions. To safeguard tabulators left unattended at polling sites overnight during early voting and in the lead-up to Election Day, the Santa Fe County Clerk's Office implemented a series of robust security measures. First, the office affixed removable GPS trackers within the tabulators to detect any unauthorized movement, and incorporated accelerometers to monitor disturbances during overnight periods with an alert triggered using geo-fence technology. Furthermore, the office secured the tabulators to uninterruptible power supplies to extend battery life in case of power disruptions. Finally, to address potential power outages or circuit breaker incidents, the office installed specialized plugs equipped with notifications, providing timely alerts if power to the tabulator is interrupted. These measures demonstrate the office’s commitment to ensuring elections are secure and trustworthy. By staying ahead in cybersecurity, the Santa Fe County Clerk's Office sets a high standard for election administration, emphasizing transparency and accountability. The office plans to expand this program for the 2024 primary and general elections. &nbsp;</p>

The Recorder's Office repurposed the Check-in-Center (CIC) program to provide 78 sites throughout the county to stand as collection sites for all ballots cast at vote centers. Each vote center, with its unique service area, is assigned to a specific CIC, which collects Ballot Transport Boxes (BTBs) and Ballot Security Envelopes (BSEs) from each vote center and transports them to the Tally Operation Center. BTBs contain voted Ballot Marking Device (BMD) ballots, damaged BMD ballots and the Official Ballot Statement. BSEs contain Vote-by-Mail (VBM) Envelopes, Conditional Voter Registration Envelopes, Provisional Envelopes, Paper Write-in Envelopes, Unsigned Ballot Statements returned by voters, and Signature Verification Statement returned by voters. Each BTB and BSE has a unique barcode label allowing for chain-of-custody. During prior election cycles, data collection revealed that tracking ballots were returned to a CIC without a label. In 2022, the CIC program implemented a replacement label to track unmarked BTBs and BSEs. The replacement label provided CIC and vote center staff the ability to write down the service area, CIC, and sequence number, which reduced the hours needed to track ballots accurately.&nbsp;</p>

FSTs/CCAs safeguard the election equipment. There were 12,000 device-related incidents reported for the March 2020 election, which were reduced by half for the 2022 gubernatorial recall election. This was due to RR/CC including computer-based training with modules, instructional videos, assessments, and updates to the in-person training to include hands-on labs and a testing simulation. This created a higher standard of qualified staff to address and resolve potential voting equipment issues. Additionally, training was reduced from a five-day class to a one-day (10-hour) class. Now training over 1,100 FSTs/CCAs takes eight days as opposed to several weeks. With this program in place, FSTs and CCAs can now resolve more issues on-site without escalation, reducing attrition, lowering costs, achieving better device resolutions, and improving the overall voter experience.&nbsp;</p>

While the resources and training needed for this method were low, the time consumption was high. Sarasota County VBM department staff identified an automated solution using an existing bar code on the voter certificate that saved hours of work. By utilizing an Excel file that contained the barcode, the voter's name, ID number, and ballot style, a log form was created that presented this information in an easy-to-read format. When the barcode is scanned using a USB barcode reader, it populates the log sheet. Using the XLOOPUP function in Excel, the scanned barcode is referenced, which returns the information from the same row in the excel data sheet. This allows the user to scan one barcode and instantly populate the voter name, voter id number, and ballot style onto the log sheet. Time saved in staff work hours, along with improved methods of proofing, not only streamlined the process but also provided greater efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

The county had developed a reputation of being historically the last to report election results, routinely well past the 10 p.m. news. Part of the problem identified was the time required to drive the individual precinct results from locations on the southeastern and northeastern points of the county to the courthouse location on the western edge of the county. While this effort was organized by the Tazewell County Clerk &amp; Recorder of Deeds, it was successful because of participation of the Tazewell County Emergency Management Agency and Tazewell County Maintenance Department to help with the transportation of ballots. This effort resulted in a reduction in the time required to accomplish this task. The average reporting time is now 9 p.m.—two hours less than the previous average. &nbsp;</p>

Then in 2023, Supervisor Latimer decided to broaden the every-other-year art contest and make it an annual event, including the first “Future Voter” sticker contest to help engage K - 8th grade students in democracy. The selected finalists included stickers with American flags, bald eagles, and a diverse representation of young people to signify future voters. &nbsp;</p>
