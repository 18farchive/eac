            <p>The <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002</a> led to the establishment of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and mandated the Commission to oversee the certification, decertification, and recertification of voting systems. This legislation marked the first instance of federal oversight in these activities and resulted in the creation of the EAC’s Voting System Testing &amp; Certification Program (T&amp;C). Since HAVA was enacted, the EAC has implemented new initiatives to assist election officials, including the Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP) and Field Services Program (FSP).</p>

<p>The EAC's Election Technology Division encompasses the Voting System Testing &amp; Certification Program (T&amp;C), Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP), and Field Services Program (FSP). These programs support state and local election officials by ensuring the reliability and security of voting systems and election-supporting technologies used in national elections.</p>

            <h2>Voting System Testing &amp; Certification Program (T&amp;C)</h2>

<p>The EAC’s Voting System Testing &amp; Certification Program supports state and local election officials nationwide by providing voting system testing and certification for the hardware and software used in their voting systems. This has allowed states to procure new certified voting systems without the added expense of independent testing and certification. The program also provides for the accreditation of voting system testing laboratories. These accredited laboratories evaluate the voting systems to ensure they comply with federal standards.</p>

<p>The EAC’s Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP) is responsible for establishing requirements and guidelines specific to election technologies that are not covered under the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), which includes electronic poll books (EPBs), electronic ballot delivery (EBD) systems, election night reporting (ENR) systems, and voter registration (VR) systems. This program was formally adopted by EAC Commissioners on December 4, 2023. ESTEP aims to create draft standards that can be used by voting system test laboratories (VSTLs) or other testing partners, administer pilot and certification test campaigns, and report on the findings of these campaigns.</p>
